# A Functional and Aesthetic Rails Blog

## Goals

Having completed [Hartl's RoR Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org) and a few other tutorials, I'd like to mirror the Rails magic in a new micropost platform, but with an emphasis on CSS (thanks to [Nettuts+ Learn CSS in 30 Days](http://learncss.tutsplus.com/)).

This blog will serve as the test zone for my CSS and Rails experimentation as a 3-month-old Rails student.
